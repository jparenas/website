I am interested in all fields of Computer Science, although I have focused in Data Science, Machine Learning, Full Stack Development, and always trying to learn new technologies and techniques, most of them outside of the academic scope. Outside of work I like photography and walking around. You can either see my resume for a concise view of most of what is in this page, or keep looking for more information on what I have done.",
